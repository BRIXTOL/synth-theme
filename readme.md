## @brixtol/synth-theme

###### A [CONSTRUCT-UI](#) STYLE THEME

This package contains the theme styles and customization for the [mithril.js](#) UI library [Construct-UI](#). Synth is an internal application used by us here at [Brixtol Textiles](#) which leverages the Construct UI library.

> **Please note** There is very little use case for this package outside of our work here at Brixtol and is not available on public npm registry.

### Why?

Our internal codebase is a combination multi/mono repository that is built atop of [pnpm](#) workspaces. We seperated the styling customisations from the synth project and consume this package as a dependency in the workspace.

**Install**

```
pnpm i @brixtol/synth-theme
```

> This package not available on the NPM registry!
